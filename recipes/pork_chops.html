<h2>
    Ingredients
</h2>
<Ul>
    <li>4 (5 ounce) pork chops</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>¼ cup honey</li>
    <li>¼ cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>

<h2>
    Steps
</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
    <li>Season pork chops with salt, pepper, and garlic powder on both sides.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in an oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat until hot. <br>
        Sear pork chops until golden brown and cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes per side. <br>
        Transfer to a plate and keep warm.
    </li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium and melt butter in the pan juices, scraping up any <br>
        browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add garlic and cook until fragrant,<br>
        about 30 seconds. Add honey, water, and vinegar. Increase heat to medium-high <br>
        and cook, stirring occasionally until sauce has reduced down and slightly<br>
        thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Return pork back to the skillet and baste <br>
        generously with the sauce. </li>
    <li>Transfer skillet under the broiler and broil until edges of pork chops <br>
        are slightly charred, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
</ol>
